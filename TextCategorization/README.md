#TEXT CLASSIFICATION
===================
This project aims to classify text into predefined categories using a naive bayes classifier.This was done as part of my minor project at Delhi Colleg of Engineering, Delhi.

The training and testing was done on the 4 news group data and the 20 news group data. I have included the 4 news group data sample from http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/demos/tutorial/classify/read-me.html

20 news group data can be found here :http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

I referred to the text classification tutorials on LingPipe and StanfordCoreNLP as inspiration for this project.
